-ADDING MODELS (User, Acitivty, Goal, Relationship)
	1. Add model
	2. Determine attributes for model
	3. Determine associations between model (if more than one model)
	4. Repeat until no other models.

Next step:

1) Activity model:
	* create
	* edit
	* delete
	* show
	* index (create a dynamic calendar where clicking in cells will either show the existing activity or will create a new one)
2) create a type model
	* types has_many activities, activities belongs_to types
3) create a feed at the root
4) enable users to destroy themselves but not other users
5) create a user index that only admins can access which allows admins to delete users
	* tests
	* controller method/views
